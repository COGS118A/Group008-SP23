        "# Abstract \n",
        "This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that predicts an individual's likelihood and pattern of smoking based on the UK smoking dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/smoking-dataset-from-uk). The dataset comprises 1691 observations across 12 variables including demographic details such as gender, age, marital status, education level, nationality, ethnicity, income, and region, alongside smoking-related indicators such as smoking status, quantity smoked on weekdays and weekends, and the type of cigarette preferred. The objective is to discern the latent patterns and relationships within these variables, leveraging them to create a robust predictive model. The project will include a rigorous process of model selection and feature selection, aimed at optimizing the performance of our machine learning system. Evaluation of the model's performance will be multifaceted, employing several appropriate metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment. The ultimate goal is to create a model that accurately fits the provided data and generalizes effectively to unseen instances, thereby providing useful insights into the dynamics of smoking behavior."

        "\n",
        "Health is a common concern all over the world. While notorious diseases like all kinds of cancers represent our idea of how our body can cease to perform normally, it is often overlooked that smoking, so common that people smoke regularly to destress, has caused more than 480,000 deaths annually<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1). With the severity of smoking in mind, it is natural to think that we should try our best to prevent people from smoking as much as possible. So, which group of people should we target and convince them to quit smoking? \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "There is plenty of research done on what factors could make someone more or less to smoke. For example, studies have shown that non-Hispanic Black cohabitors, separated non-Hispanic White adults, and single/never married Hispanic adults have a really high prevalence of cigarette smoking compared to groups of people with other marital status and ethnicities<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#cite_note-2). This implies that marital status and ethnicity both could potentially be indicators for a smoker/non-smoker. These 2 variables are also what we will be looking at in this project. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Gender, as another factor, has also been studied before. It is found that in almost all countries, cigarette usage is more popular among men than among women<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#cite_note-3). However, some countries like the UK show a smaller difference between prevalence of smoking among men and women. This implies that maybe gender is not a significant indicator for smoking among people in the UK, which is where our dataset is based. We will look deeper into this later in the project.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Income is another factor considered by researchers. It has been found that the worsening of social circumstances, normally related to lower income, could cause higher smoking risk<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#cite_note-4). However, as personal income decreases, it could be the case that such individuals would be less likely to consider spending money on cigarettes since they are not a necessity of life. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "All factors discussed above can vary a lot across different groups of people all over the world. In this proposed project, we will try our best to explore such factors and their influences on the people of the UK, more specifically the individuals contained in our dataset. Smoking usage can be very much correlated with cultural and social norms, so more studies will be needed if we were to extend any conclusions we draw from this project.\n"

        "The problem we will be aiming to address is to determine which machine learning classifier has the best performance to classify whether a UK resident smoke or not. The output feature we are going to use is the [smoke] variable in the dataset, which is a binary value with only yes or no options. The potential algorithms we are going to try include but not limited to linear SVM, RBF SVM, KNN, logistic regression, and random forest. Since there are so many features, KNN might not do a good job on the prediction task. Eventually, we might exclude KNN. Random forest might be a good approach since most of our input features nominal categorical values. After preprocessing and EDA, we will split the data into a training set and testing set. Each algorithm will be trained using the same training data and the hyperparameters of all these algorithms will also be optimized. Finally, we will use precision, recall, and f1-score to compare the performance of these algorithms on the testing set."

After that, we will use random forest to specify the desired number of trees in the forest and other hyperparameters. Fit it into our training data, and let it learn relationships between features and output(smoking[yes/no]). Additionally, when we do model evaluation, we will predict whether people are smoking or not first of the test set using the trained classifier, and then compare the prediction with the true labels from the test set, then use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall to calculate the evaluation to know the performance of the model. \n",
